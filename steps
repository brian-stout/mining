#TODO:

1. Trace the map at the start
    o   Find the first wall, note the location, go clock wise
    o   Go to the bottom first wall, note the location, go counter clock wise
    o   Finished tracing when the first drone gets to the second location, second drone
            gets to the first location
2. Create a graph
    o   Walls should terminate the node, so the program can determine if a graph is open
            (still undiscovered nodes,) or closed (completely discovered)
3. After a Drone's bulk scouting procedures, it should automatically seek to close the graph

4. After a map is complelty mined, a drone should go to another map and help there

EXTRA STUFF
5. Have a drone keep track of HP and avoid acid pools if it'll kill them when returning
        home.
